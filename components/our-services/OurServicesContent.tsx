          Radiology is a medical specialty that uses imaging to diagnose and
          treat disease seen within the body. Radiologists use a variety of
          imaging techniques such as X-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed
          tomography (CT), nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET)
          and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose or treat diseases.
          Interventional radiology is the performance of (usually minimally
          invasive) medical procedures with the guidance of imaging
          technologies.

          The acquisition of medical imaging is usually carried out by the
          radiographer. Depending on location, the diagnostic radiologist or
          reporting radiographer, then interprets or "reads" the images and
          produces a report of their findings and impression or diagnosis. This
          report is then transmitted to the physician who ordered the imaging,
          either routinely or emergently. Specialist physicians often look at
          images themselves although are less expert than radiologists. Examples
          include orthopedic surgeons reading X-rays and MRIs of bones and
          joints, cardiologists reading cardiac nuclear medicine and performing
          and reading coronary artery angiograms, obstetricians reading
          obstetric ultrasounds, pulmonologists reading chest X-rays and chest
          CT scans, etc
